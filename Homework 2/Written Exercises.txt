1.Explain why do we want somentimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
Because sometimes we need to give higher priority to some callbacks. Then a function that is scheduled with setImmediate will be executed on the check phase of the event loop, 
and that will be executed before functions that are scheduled with setTimeout. setTimeout schedules functions to be executed on the timers phase of the event loop.

2.Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
process.nextTick has the highest priority to be executed and it is not part of the event loop. After the current operation completes process.nextTick blocks the event loop to continue
and executes the processes that are in the nextTick queue, after all the processes that were in the nextTick queue being completed the flow goes back to the event loop.
