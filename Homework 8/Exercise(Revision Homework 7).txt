We can improve the performance in queries creating some indexes. It will decreasing the response time when executing queries.
My suggestion for indexes would be the following of the following schema. In that case I would create one regular index for 
the keyvalue ISBNNumber, and more 3 multikey indexes for authors, keywords, and borrowings key values.



{
    ISBNNumber:'',
    title:'',
    authors:['','',''],
    keywords:['','',''],
    borrowings:[{studentID:'', studentName:'', studentEmail:'', studentPhoneNumber:'', borrowingDate:'', returningDate:''},
                {studentID:'', studentName:'', studentEmail:'', studentPhoneNumber:'', borrowingDate:'', returningDate:''}]
}

db.books.createIndex({ISBNNumber:1});
db.books.createIndex({borrowings:1});
db.books.createIndex({keywords:1});
db.books.createIndex({authors:1});
